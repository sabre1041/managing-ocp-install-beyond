=== Managing the lifecycle of an Application

In this lab, you will deploy an application to Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform and use the tools previously deployed to investigate how to manage the application.

== Deploy a Sample Application

One of the steps to validate the successful installation of an OpenShift Container Platform cluster is to build and deploy a sample application. OpenShift contains a number of quickstart templates that can be used to demonstrate different application frameworks along with the integration with a backend data store. One of these example applications consists of a CakePHP based web application with state stored in a MySQL database.

We will now put our cluster administrator hat aside and complete the majority of this lab as a developer by using the OpenShift web console to build and deploy the sample application.

Navigate to link:https://master.osp.example.com:8443[https://master.osp.example.com:8443] and login using the following credentials.

Username: **user1** +
Password: **summit2017**

Since _user1_ does not currently have access to any projects, the only actions that can be taken in the web console is to create a new project. Click on the **New Project** button.

Enter the following information on the new project wizard:

Name: **cakephp-mysql-persistent** +
Display Name: **CakePHP MySQL Persistent** +
Description: **Sample Project Demonstrating A CakePHP MySQL Application Using Persistent Storage**

Click the **Create** button to create the project 

You are presented with a catalog of items that you can add to your project. In a typical OpenShift cluster, this catalog would be filled with numerous programming languages emphasizing polyglot development and tools to implement Continuous Integration. In the lab environment, there is only one programming language option, PHP. Click on the **PHP** language to display the available options.

You are presented with one option; an OpenShift link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.4/architecture/core_concepts/templates.html[template] which contains the various OpenShift components to build and deploy a CakePHP based application along with a MySQL database backed by persistent storage. The goal of this lab is to use this template to validate the build and deployment capabilities of the platform along with the dynamic allocation of Persistent Volumes for the storage of the backend database.

Click the _Select_ button under the **CakePHP + MySQL (Persistent)** card which will display the images that will be used as part of this template instantiation along with parameters that can be used to inject custom logic.


One of the parameters that we will customize is the location of the Git repository containing the source code of the CakePHP application. The location will point to the Git repository that is running on the repository machine:

Modify the **Git Repository URL** parameter with the following value:

Git Repository URL: link:http://repo.osp.example.com/git/openshift/cakephp-ex.git[http://repo.osp.example.com/git/openshift/cakephp-ex.git]
 
Scroll to the bottom of the page and select the **Create** button to instantiate the template.

A page displaying the successful instantiation of the template will be displayed along with a set of next steps that you can take against the application. Click the **Continue to Overview** link to return to the project homepage.

== Validating Application Deployment

After triggering instantiating the template, a new Source to Image build of the CakePHP application will begin.

View the build by selecting **Builds** and the **Builds**

Select **cakephp-mysql-persistent** to view the builds for the application. From this page, you can view build status along with the logs produced

To investigate the status of all pods within the project, select **Application** and then **Pods**

image::images/image2.png[]

Pods that are in a healthy condition will either have a status of Running or completed.

NOTE: If either the _mysql_ or _cakephp_ are not in a healthy state, triggering a new deployment may rectify the issue.

New deployments can be initiated from the deployments page by selecting **Applications** and the **Deployments**.

Select either mysql and then _cakephp-mysql-persistent_ depending on the application to be deployed.

On the top right corner, click **Deploy** to trigger a new deployment if needed.

=== View Application

Click on **Overview** from the left hand navigation bar to return to the overview page.

NOTE: You may see an error getting metrics. This is safe to ignore for now as it will be covered in a subsequent section.

You should be able to see both the CakePHP and MySQL applications running.

The template automatically creates a route to provide external access to the application. The link is available at the top right corner of the page. Click the link to navigate to the application:

link:http://cakephp-mysql-persistent-cakephp-mysql-persistent.apps.example.com[http://cakephp-mysql-persistent-cakephp-mysql-persistent.apps.example.com]

=== Viewing Application

Application users and administrators have the ability to leverage several facilities for monitoring the state of an application deployed to the OpenShift Container Platform. While not deployed to the lab environment, OpenShift provides an link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.4/install_config/aggregate_logging.html[aggregated logging framework] based on the ELK (Elasticsearch, Fluentd and Kibana) stack. However, you can still utilize the telemetry captured by the cluster metrics mechanisms. Cluster metrics were deployed as part of the OpenShift installation and are being used to drive Red Hat CloudForms.

With the _cakephp-mysql-persistent_ application deployed, you can use the OpenShift web console to view metrics that has been gathered by the cluster metrics facility. Since the metrics facility within the web console reaches out to Hawkular deployed in OpenShift from your web browser, you will need to perform one additional step to configure your browser to trust the self signed certificate configured before metrics can start to be displayed.

    . From the overview page, click on **Applications** on the lefthand side
    . Select **Pods**
    . Select the _Running cakephp_ pod
    . Navigate to the Metrics tab.

Click on the link displayed which will connect to the Hawkular endpoint. Accept the self signed certificate and if successful, you will see the Hawkular logo along with additional details about the status of the service.

NOTE: After clicking on the URL noted above, it may hang for a bit as it tries to go online. It will continue after a while.

Return to the OpenShift overview page for the _cakephp-mysql-persistent_ project by clicking the **Overview** link on the left side where you should be able to see metrics displaying next to each pod.

Additional details relating to the performance of the application can be viewed by revisiting the _Metrics_ tab within each pod as previously described.

While normal consumers of the platform are able to view metrics for only the applications they have permissions to access, cluster administrators can make use of Red Hat CloudForms to view metrics from all applications deployed to the OpenShift Container platform from a single pane of glass.

=== Navigate through the OpenShift Web Console

With an application deployed to the OpenShift cluster, we can navigate through the various options exposed by the OpenShift web console. Use this time as an opportunity to explore the following sections at your own pace:

* Various details provided with each pod including pod details, application logs and the ability to access a remote shell
    ** Hover over **Applications** from the left hand navigation bar and select **Pods**. Select one of the available pods and navigate through each of the provided tabs
* Secrets used by the platform and the _CakePHP_ application
    ** Hover over **Resources** from the left hand navigation bar and select **Secrets**
* Persistent storage dynamically allocated by the cluster to support MySQL
    ** Click on the **Storage** tab

If desired, connect to OpenStack and view the volumes created using the steps described in a prior lab.
