=== Where do we go from here?

The lab may be coming to a close, but that does not mean that you need to stop once you leave the session.

Let’s recap what you have accomplished during this session.

* Ansible Tower was used to execute Ansible playbooks to provision a Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster
    ** Instances were created within AWS
    ** Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform was installed and configured
        *** Platform metrics were automatically deployed
* Prometheus and Grafana
    ** Prometheus was used to query metrics exposed by OpenShift
    ** Grafana was deployed to visualize metrics from Prometheus
* Dynamically scaled up OpenShift Environment
   ** Built a custom Ansible Playbook Bundle to support the deployment of an application to aid in cluster scaleup
   ** Used metrics obtained by Prometheus to trigger an Ansible Tower job to scale up the OpenShift cluster
* Red Hat Cloudforms was deployed within the Red Hat Container Platform cluster
    ** CloudForms was integrated with Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform to monitor the cluster
* Two sample applications were deployed using persistent storage deployed on the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform
* Ansible Tower was used to execute Ansible playbooks to expand the cluster
    ** New instances were deployed within AWS
    ** An additional Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform node was installed and the cluster was updated
