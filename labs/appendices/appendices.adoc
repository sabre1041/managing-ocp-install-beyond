== Appendix A - Manually Cleanup Cinder Volume

How to manually clean up a volume that will not delete with openstack volume delete

From the OpenStack server:

.rhosp$
[bash, source]
----
rhosp$ openstack volume list
rhosp$ sudo -i 
rhosp# source ~/.keystonerc_admin
rhosp#openstack volume set --state available 09d601f8-4159-4979-ae77-441920564230
rhosp$ mysql -u root cinder

# MariaDB [cinder]>  delete from volumes where id='09d601f8-4159-4979-ae77-441920564230';
# MariaDB [cinder]>  update volumes set attach_status="detached" where id="09d601f8-4159-4979-ae77-441920564230";

rhosp$ openstack volume delete 09d601f8-4159-4979-ae77-441920564230

The quickest way to remedy this is to delete the project and start over

.master$
----
master$ oc delete project cloudforms
----

Now return the the lab and try again <<Lab 4 - Installing Red Hat CloudForms>>

== Appendix E - Troubleshooting CloudForms

Try to curl the CloudForms application, this may fail.

.master$
[source, bash]
----
master$ curl -Ik https://cloudforms-cloudforms.apps.example.com
----

If this matches the web browserâ€™s output of **Application Not Available** or status code of **503**. then something failed in the deployment.

List the pods in the _default_ project

.master$
[source, bash]
----
master$ oc get pods -n default
----

List services in the default project

.master$
[source, bash]
----
master$ oc get services
----

Try curl against the cloudforms service IP

.master$
[source, bash]
----
master$ curl -Ik http://72.30.126.6
----

If the router is in error state, delete it

.master$
[source, bash]
----
master$ oc delete pod router -n default
----

Watch the router get deployed

.master$
[source, bash]
----
master$ oc get pods -n default -w
----

The cloudforms application should work now if the router came up cleanly

.master$
[source, bash]
----
master$ curl -Ik https://cloudforms-cloudforms.apps.example.com
----
